# Research Specification: Commercial and Retail Categories

## Project Context
We are building a personal cider journaling app called "Cider Dictionary" for a dedicated cider enthusiast whose goal is to systematically collect and catalog every possible cider variety. The user wants to achieve "collection completeness" by trying a cider with every characteristic at least once.

## Research Objective
Understand how the commercial cider market categorizes and positions products to ensure our classification system aligns with real-world availability and consumer purchasing decisions.

- **Scrumpy Jack**: Mass market positioning
- **Regional producers**: Local brand categorization approaches

### 2. Retail and Supermarket Categories
Research how retailers organize cider sections:
- **Supermarket categories**: Tesco, Sainsbury's, ASDA cider organization

- **Demographic targeting**: Age, gender, lifestyle-based positioning

### 6. Distribution and Availability Categories
Research product availability patterns:
- **National brands**: Widely available commercial ciders
- **Regional specialties**: Geographically limited producers
- **Seasonal availability**: Limited release and seasonal products
- **Limited editions**: Special releases and vintage ciders
- **Direct sales**: Cidery-only and specialty distribution
