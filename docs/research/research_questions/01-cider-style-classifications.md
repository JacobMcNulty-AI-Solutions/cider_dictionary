# Research Specification: Cider Style Classifications

## Project Context
We are building a personal cider journaling app called "Cider Dictionary" for a dedicated cider enthusiast whose goal is to systematically collect and catalog every possible cider variety. The user wants to achieve "collection completeness" by trying a cider with every characteristic at least once.

## Research Objective
Identify comprehensive cider style classification systems that will help define what constitutes "trying all ciders" from a style perspective.

## Specific Research Tasks

### 1. Official Style Guidelines
Research authoritative cider classification systems:
- **BJCP (Beer Judge Certification Program)** cider categories and subcategories
- **CAMRA (Campaign for Real Ale)** cider classifications
- **NACM (National Association of Cider Makers)** standards if available
- Any other official brewing/cider industry classification systems

### 2. Regional Style Classifications
Research geographic/regional cider traditions:
- **English styles**: Traditional English categories, regional variations
- **French styles**: Normandy, Brittany classifications
- **American styles**: New England, Pacific Northwest, etc.
- **Other European**: German, Spanish, Italian cider styles
- **Emerging regions**: Australian, Canadian, etc.

### 3. Production Method Classifications
Research how production methods define styles:
- **Traditional methods**: Keeved, wild fermented, farmhouse
- **Modern methods**: Controlled fermentation, filtered, pasteurized
- **Specialty methods**: Ice cider, pét-nat, méthode champenoise
- **Aging classifications**: Steel, oak, bottle-conditioned

### 4. Commercial Style Categories
Research how the industry currently categorizes ciders:
- **Craft vs mass-market** distinctions
- **Retailer categories**: How supermarkets/bottle shops organize ciders
- **Pub/restaurant classifications**: How venues categorize on menus
- **Marketing categories**: How brands position their products

## Deliverables Required

### 1. Hierarchical Classification System
Provide a structured taxonomy that could be used in a database, such as:
```
Traditional English
├── Scrumpy
├── Traditional Dry
├── Traditional Medium
└── Traditional Sweet

Modern Fruit
├── Single Fruit
├── Mixed Fruit
└── Exotic Fruit
```

### 2. Completeness Criteria
Define what would constitute "trying all styles" - how many distinct style categories exist that someone would need to try to achieve completeness.

### 3. Practical Implementation
Recommend which classification system(s) would be most practical for:
- A UK-based cider enthusiast
- Personal collection tracking
- Ensuring comprehensive coverage of available cider styles

## Success Criteria
The research should enable us to create a dropdown/selection system in the app where users can categorize every cider they try, and track progress toward trying all possible style combinations.

## Output Format
Please structure findings as:
1. **Summary of major classification systems**
2. **Recommended taxonomy for our app**
3. **Completeness matrix** showing all style combinations to try
4. **Sources and references** for further investigation
