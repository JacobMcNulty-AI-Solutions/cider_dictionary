# Research Specification: Apple Varieties and Fruit Types

## Project Context
We are building a personal cider journaling app called "Cider Dictionary" for a dedicated cider enthusiast whose goal is to systematically collect and catalog every possible cider variety. The user wants to achieve "collection completeness" by trying a cider with every characteristic at least once.

## Research Objective
Identify comprehensive classifications of apples and other fruits used in cider production to enable systematic tracking of fruit-based characteristics in the collection.

## Specific Research Tasks

### 1. Cider-Specific Apple Classifications
Research traditional cider apple categories:
- **Bittersweet apples**: High tannin, low acid varieties
- **Bittersharp apples**: High tannin, high acid varieties
- **Sweet apples**: Low tannin, low acid varieties
- **Sharp apples**: Low tannin, high acid varieties
- **Specific heritage varieties**: Dabinett, Kingston Black, Yarlington Mill, etc.

### 2. Culinary Apple Varieties in Cider
Research common eating/cooking apples used for cider:
- **Dessert apples**: Braeburn, Gala, Pink Lady, etc.
- **Cooking apples**: Bramley, etc.
- **Regional varieties**: Local/regional apples commonly used
- **Availability**: Which varieties are commonly found in commercial ciders

### 3. Single Variety vs Blend Classifications
Research how cider makers approach apple combinations:
- **Single variety ciders**: Purist approach using one apple type
- **Traditional blends**: Classic combinations for balance
- **Modern blends**: Contemporary approaches to mixing varieties
- **Seasonal variations**: How apple availability affects blending

### 4. Other Fruits in Cider Production
Research non-apple fruits used in cider:
- **Pears**: Perry-specific varieties vs dessert pears
- **Stone fruits**: Plums, apricots, cherries
- **Berries**: Blackberries, elderberries, etc.
- **Exotic fruits**: Tropical fruits, unusual combinations
- **Fruit additions**: Fresh vs concentrated vs flavoring

### 5. Fruit Processing and Characteristics
Research how fruit processing affects characteristics:
- **Harvest timing**: Early vs late harvest impact
- **Processing methods**: Whole fruit vs juice vs concentrate
- **Fruit percentages**: Typical ratios in blended ciders
- **Fruit sourcing**: Local vs imported fruit impact

## Deliverables Required

### 1. Fruit Classification Taxonomy
Provide a structured system for categorizing ciders by fruit content:
```
Apple Types
├── Traditional Cider Apples
│   ├── Bittersweet
│   ├── Bittersharp
│   ├── Sweet
│   └── Sharp
├── Culinary Apples
│   ├── Dessert
│   └── Cooking
└── Heritage/Rare Varieties

Other Fruits
├── Pears (Perry)
├── Stone Fruits
├── Berries
└── Exotic/Tropical
```

### 2. Collection Completeness Matrix
Define what would constitute "trying all fruit types" - create a matrix of:
- Apple variety categories to try
- Other fruit types to experience
- Combination types (single vs blend categories)

### 3. Practical Identification Guide
Provide guidance for identifying fruit characteristics:
- How to determine apple varieties from commercial cider labels
- Common terminology used by cider makers
- Regional fruit specialties to look for

### 4. UK Market Focus
Since user is UK-based, provide specific focus on:
- UK heritage apple varieties
- Common UK commercial cider fruit sources
- Regional UK fruit specialties (Somerset, Herefordshire, etc.)

## Success Criteria
The research should enable creation of a comprehensive fruit classification system that allows tracking progress toward trying all major fruit types and combinations used in cider production.

## Output Format
Please structure findings as:
1. **Complete fruit taxonomy with examples**
2. **UK-specific fruit guide**
3. **Collection completeness checklist**
4. **Identification guide for commercial ciders**
5. **Sources and references**
