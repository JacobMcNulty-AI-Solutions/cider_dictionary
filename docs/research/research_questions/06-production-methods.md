# Research Specification: Production Methods

## Project Context
We are building a personal cider journaling app called "Cider Dictionary" for a dedicated cider enthusiast whose goal is to systematically collect and catalog every possible cider variety. The user wants to achieve "collection completeness" by trying a cider with every characteristic at least once.

## Research Objective
Identify comprehensive production method classifications that significantly impact cider characteristics, enabling systematic tracking of production diversity in the collection.

## Specific Research Tasks

### 1. Fermentation Method Classifications
Research different fermentation approaches:
- **Wild fermentation**: Spontaneous, native yeast characteristics
- **Cultured yeast**: Commercial yeast strain varieties and characteristics
- **Mixed fermentation**: Wild + cultured combinations
- **Secondary fermentation**: Bottle conditioning, tank conditioning
- **Malolactic fermentation**: MLF impact on cider characteristics
- **Co-fermentation**: Simultaneous fermentation with different ingredients

### 2. Traditional Production Methods
Research heritage and traditional techniques:
- **Keeving**: Traditional English clarification method
- **Méthode ancestrale**: Traditional sparkling production
- **Farmhouse methods**: Historical small-scale production
- **Regional techniques**: Area-specific traditional methods
- **Hand-pressed**: Traditional pressing vs modern methods
- **Natural processing**: Minimal intervention approaches

### 3. Modern Industrial Methods
Research contemporary commercial production:
- **Sterile filtration**: Clarification and stabilization methods
- **Pasteurization**: Heat treatment impact on flavor
- **Concentrate-based**: Juice concentrate vs fresh juice production
- **Controlled environment**: Temperature, pH, nutrient management
- **Accelerated aging**: Techniques for rapid flavor development
- **Blending techniques**: Post-fermentation blending approaches

### 4. Specialty Production Techniques
Research unique production methods:
- **Ice cider**: Freeze concentration techniques
- **Pét-nat**: Natural sparkling production methods
- **Solera aging**: Continuous aging system adaptations
- **Barrel aging**: Various wood aging approaches
- **Sour cider**: Intentional acidification techniques
- **Fortification**: Spirit addition methods

### 5. Processing and Clarification Methods
Research post-fermentation processing:
- **Filtration types**: Rough, fine, sterile filtration
- **Fining agents**: Gelatin, isinglass, bentonite, etc.
- **Cold stabilization**: Temperature-based clarification
- **Natural settling**: Time-based clarification
- **Centrifugation**: Mechanical clarification
- **Carbonation methods**: Natural vs forced carbonation

### 6. Quality Control and Consistency Methods
Research production control techniques:
- **Laboratory analysis**: Testing and adjustment protocols
- **Blending for consistency**: Batch-to-batch standardization
- **Microbiological control**: Contamination prevention
- **Oxidation control**: Antioxidant and handling techniques
- **Temperature control**: Fermentation and storage management
- **Packaging considerations**: Impact of bottling/canning on characteristics

## Deliverables Required

└── Fortification
```

### 2. Production Impact Guide
Explain how different methods affect cider characteristics:
- Flavor impact of each production method
- Visual/textural differences
- Shelf stability and aging potential
- Typical alcohol and sweetness outcomes

### 3. Identification Guide for Consumers
Provide methods for identifying production techniques:
- Label terminology indicating production methods
- Sensory cues for different production approaches
- Price and packaging indicators of production type

### 4. Collection Completeness Framework
Define systematic approach to trying all production methods:
- Priority production methods for comprehensive collection
- Availability of different production styles in UK market
- Seasonal or limited availability considerations

### 5. UK Production Landscape
Focus on UK-specific production approaches:
- Traditional UK production methods still in use
- Modern UK commercial production standards
- UK craft cider production innovation trends
- Regional UK production specialties

## Success Criteria
The research should enable creation of a comprehensive production method classification system that allows tracking of production diversity and progress toward experiencing all major production approaches.

## Output Format

1. **Complete production method taxonomy**
2. **Production impact and identification guide**
3. **UK production landscape overview**
4. **Collection strategy for production diversity**
5. **Commercial availability of different production styles**
6. **Sources and technical references**
