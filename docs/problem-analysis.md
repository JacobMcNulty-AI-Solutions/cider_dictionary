# Problem Analysis

## Problem Statement

### Core Goal: Complete Cider Collection & Cataloging
The user wants to systematically **collect and catalog every cider**, treating cider exploration like a comprehensive collection hobby. The goal is to try all possible cider varieties and document each experience with full characteristics and location data.

### Current Pain Points
1. **No Collection Tracking**: Can't systematically track progress toward trying "all ciders"
2. **Missing Discovery Detection**: No way to quickly identify if a cider is new to the collection
3. **Unstructured Data**: Photos and mental notes can't be analyzed for patterns or insights
4. **Lost Context**: Can't remember where they tried something, how much it cost, or specific experiences
5. **No Price Analysis**: Can't identify most expensive venues, ciders, or best value options
6. **Incomplete Characteristics**: No systematic way to ensure all cider types/styles are documented

### Specific User Behaviors & Context
Our target user:
- Drinks cider everywhere possible (home, pubs, events, restaurants)
- Always curious to try new ciders when available
- Drinks socially with friends who rely on their recommendations
- Currently uses unstructured photo system that often gets forgotten
- Has no spending limits (cider is a serious hobby)
- Wants to track purchase location and price for value analysis

## Target Users

### Primary User Profile
**The Serious Cider Hobbyist with Memory Overload**
- **Demographics**: Dedicated cider enthusiast with unlimited hobby budget
- **Behavior**: Drinks cider wherever possible (1-2x/week), extremely curious about new varieties
- **Social Role**: The "cider expert" friend who gives recommendations to social circle
- **Current Crisis**: Has tried so many ciders that recognition has become unreliable
- **Motivation**: Wants to catalog every cider and become the person who has "tried them all"

### Unique User Characteristics
- **Solo Enthusiast**: Only cider lover in their social circle
- **Practical Learner**: Learns through experience rather than study/reading
- **Value Conscious**: Despite unlimited budget, wants to identify best price-to-quality ratios
- **Recommendation Engine**: Friends rely on them for cider suggestions
- **Completionist Mindset**: Goal is comprehensive knowledge of all available ciders

### User Context & Constraints
- **Multi-Environment**: Logs from home, pubs, restaurants, festivals, shops (Sainsbury's), anywhere cider is available
- **Mobile-First**: Must work on phone in various lighting/social conditions
- **Dual Logging Types**: Quick re-try logging vs comprehensive new cider entry
- **Location Tracking**: Venue name, GPS coordinates, and venue type (pub/shop/restaurant)
- **Price Analysis Focus**: Track pricing for venue comparison and value analysis
- **Collection Completeness**: Goal to try every cider characteristic/type at least once
- **Free-form Notes**: Each entry needs space for experience-specific observations
- **Private Focus**: Personal collection tool, no social features needed

## Vision Statement

**To solve the cider recognition crisis by creating a comprehensive personal cider database that enables instant recall of every cider tried, transforms the user into the ultimate cider connoisseur, and provides data-driven insights for both personal enjoyment and friend recommendations.**

## Project Goals

### Critical Success Requirements
1. **Solve Recognition Crisis**: User can instantly identify if they've tried a cider before
2. **Enable Instant Recall**: Access complete history, location, price, and ratings for any cider
3. **Maximize Value Discovery**: Identify best price-to-quality ratios for smart purchasing
4. **Power Recommendations**: Quickly suggest ciders to friends based on objective data
5. **Complete Cataloging**: Build comprehensive database of all ciders, brands, types, and ABV levels

### Primary App Workflow
1. **Discovery Check**: See a cider → Open app → Search for cider name in dictionary
2. **Re-try Logging**: If found in search → Click cider → Log new entry (location, price, notes)
3. **New Cider Entry**: If not found in search → "Log new cider" → Full characteristics entry
4. **Collection Analysis**: Track progress toward trying all cider types/characteristics

### Core Interface Design
- **Cider Dictionary Page**: Main page showing all discovered ciders
- **Search Bar**: Prominent search at top of dictionary for quick discovery checking
- **Quick Access**: Fast search-to-action workflow for efficient logging

### Key Use Cases to Solve
- **Quick Discovery Check**: "Search cider name → Is it in my dictionary?"
- **Re-try Logging**: "Found in search → Click → Quick entry for location, price, notes"
- **New Discovery**: "Not found in search → Log new cider → Full characteristics entry"
- **Price Analysis**: "Where are ciders most expensive? Which have best value?"
- **Collection Progress**: "What cider types/characteristics haven't I tried yet?"
- **Venue Analysis**: "Which venues have the best cider prices?"

### Success Metrics
- **Collection Completeness**: Track progress toward trying every cider type/characteristic
- **Discovery Accuracy**: Instant identification of new vs previously tried ciders
- **Data Richness**: Every entry includes location (name, GPS, type), price, and notes
- **Price Analysis**: Clear insights on venue pricing and cider value ratios
- **Logging Efficiency**: Quick re-try logging vs comprehensive new cider entry

### Collection Completion Goal
"I would feel like I have tried all ciders once I have logged a cider with every characteristic at least once and I have stopped seeing new ciders that I haven't logged before"

### Long-term Vision: The Ultimate Cider Collector
Transform the user into someone who:
- Has systematically tried and documented every possible cider variety
- Can instantly recall any cider's characteristics, locations tried, and prices paid
- Identifies the best value ciders through comprehensive price tracking
- Uses data-driven analysis to find the most expensive venues and best deals
- Maintains detailed notes for every cider experience
- Achieves true completeness through systematic characteristic coverage

### Cost Constraints
- **Free to Maintain**: No ongoing subscription or hosting costs
- **Personal Use**: Built as individual tool, not commercial product
- **Self-Hosted Option**: User controls their own data and costs
