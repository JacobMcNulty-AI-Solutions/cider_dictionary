## Risk Assessment and Mitigation

### High-Risk Dependencies
1. **01-system-overview delays all other work**
   - Mitigation: Assign most experienced architect
   - Contingency: Parallel preliminary work on 06-performance-patterns

2. **02-data-flow-architecture complexity**
   - Risk: Complex state management patterns take longer than estimated
   - Mitigation: Focus on core patterns first, defer advanced optimizations

3. **Cross-document consistency**
   - Risk: Patterns diverge between documents
   - Mitigation: Daily consistency reviews, shared pattern library

### Medium-Risk Dependencies
1. **Firebase integration complexity**
   - Risk: Free tier constraints affect architectural decisions
   - Mitigation: Research Firebase limits upfront, design within constraints

2. **Component architecture scope creep**
   - Risk: Over-designing component patterns
   - Mitigation: Focus on core components, defer advanced patterns

### Low-Risk Dependencies
1. **Testing and deployment patterns**
   - Risk: Team has less experience with React Native testing
   - Mitigation: Research community best practices, start simple

## Quality Gates and Validation

### Critical Path Quality Gates
**After each Priority 1 document**:
1. Architecture review with technical lead
2. Cross-reference validation with pseudocode
3. Implementation feasibility check
4. Performance requirement validation

### Integration Quality Gates
**After Priority 1 completion**:
1. End-to-end architectural consistency review
2. Developer experience validation
3. Implementation effort estimation
4. Technical debt assessment

### Final Quality Gates
**After all documents**:
1. Complete architectural coverage verification
2. Implementation readiness assessment
3. Performance and security requirement confirmation
4. Development team onboarding preparation
