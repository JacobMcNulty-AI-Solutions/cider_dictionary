# Research Specification: Flavor Additives and Ingredients

## Project Context
We are building a personal cider journaling app called "Cider Dictionary" for a dedicated cider enthusiast whose goal is to systematically collect and catalog every possible cider variety. The user wants to achieve "collection completeness" by trying a cider with every characteristic at least once.

## Research Objective
Identify comprehensive classifications of additives, flavorings, and specialty ingredients used in cider production to enable systematic tracking of flavor diversity in the collection.

## Specific Research Tasks

### 1. Hop Classifications in Cider
Research hop usage in modern cider:
- **Hop varieties**: Common varieties used in cider (Citra, Mosaic, etc.)
- **Hop characteristics**: Citrus, floral, piney, earthy, etc.
- **Hopping methods**: Dry hopping, kettle hopping, hop bursting
- **Hop levels**: Lightly hopped, heavily hopped classifications
- **Regional preferences**: US vs UK hop usage patterns

### 2. Spices and Botanicals
Research traditional and modern spice additions:
- **Traditional spices**: Cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, ginger
- **Modern botanicals**: Elderflower, chamomile, lavender, etc.
- **Seasonal spices**: Pumpkin spice, mulling spices, etc.
- **Regional specialties**: Local botanical traditions
- **Usage levels**: Subtle, pronounced, dominant spice presence

### 3. Wood Aging and Barrel Types
Research wood aging classifications:
- **Wood types**: Oak, cherry, apple, chestnut, etc.
- **Barrel histories**: Bourbon, wine, sherry, rum barrels
- **Aging durations**: Short-term, medium-term, long-term aging
- **Wood treatments**: Toasted, charred, virgin wood
- **Flavor contributions**: Vanilla, smoke, tannin, fruit crossover

### 4. Sweetening and Flavoring Agents
Research sweetening and flavoring additions:
- **Natural sweeteners**: Honey, maple syrup, fruit concentrates
- **Artificial flavoring**: Commercial flavor additions
- **Back-sweetening**: Post-fermentation sweetening methods
- **Flavor intensity**: Subtle, moderate, dominant flavor presence
- **Timing of addition**: Pre-fermentation, post-fermentation, blending

### 5. Specialty Ingredients
Research unique and specialty additions:
- **Fruits**: Secondary fruit additions beyond primary apple/pear
- **Vegetables**: Pumpkin, beets, etc.
- **Coffee and tea**: Coffee beans, tea varieties
- **Unusual ingredients**: Seaweed, flowers, herbs, etc.
- **Regional specialties**: Local ingredient traditions

### 6. Processing Additives
Research technical additives that affect flavor:
- **Yeast strains**: Wild, cultured, specialty yeast flavor contributions
- **Acid additions**: Tartaric, citric, malic acid adjustments
- **Enzyme additions**: Pectinase, amylase effects
- **Clarifying agents**: Impact on flavor and mouthfeel
- **Preservatives**: Sulfites, pasteurization effects

## Deliverables Required

### 1. Additive Classification Taxonomy
Provide structured categories for all additive types:
```
Flavor Additions
├── Hops
│   ├── Citrus Character
│   ├── Floral Character
│   ├── Pine/Resin Character
│   └── Earthy Character
├── Spices & Botanicals
│   ├── Traditional Spices
│   ├── Modern Botanicals
│   └── Seasonal Specialties
├── Wood Aging
│   ├── Oak (Various Histories)
│   └── Alternative Woods
└── Specialty Ingredients
    ├── Secondary Fruits
    ├── Unusual Botanicals
    └── Processing Variants
```

### 2. Flavor Intensity Classifications
Define levels of additive presence:
- How to categorize subtle vs pronounced vs dominant flavors
- Standard terminology for describing intensity levels
- Identification methods for consumers

### 3. Collection Completeness Framework
Create systematic approach to trying all additive categories:
- Priority additive types for comprehensive collection
- Combination possibilities (multiple additives in one cider)
- Minimum number of ciders needed to experience all major additive categories

### 4. UK Market Focus
Research UK-specific additive trends:
- Popular UK cider additive preferences
- Traditional UK cider ingredients
- Emerging UK craft cider additive trends
- Availability of specialty ingredient ciders in UK market

### 5. Commercial Identification Guide
Provide guidance for identifying additives:
- How commercial labels indicate additives
- Flavor cues for identifying unlisted additives
- Common terminology used by cider makers

## Success Criteria
The research should enable creation of a comprehensive additive classification system that allows systematic tracking of flavor diversity and progress toward trying all major additive categories.

## Output Format
Please structure findings as:
1. **Complete additive taxonomy with examples**
2. **Intensity and identification guide**
3. **Collection strategy for additive diversity**
4. **UK market additive landscape**
5. **Commercial identification methods**
6. **Sources and references**
