Summary of Major Classification Systems

Cider styles are defined by several industry and competition guidelines. The BJCP (Beer Judge Certification Program) 2025 guidelines for cider/perry identify four main categories: Traditional Cider (C1), Strong Cider (C2), Specialty Cider (C3), and Perry (C4)
bjcp.org
. In Traditional Cider (C1), substyles include Common/Table, Heirloom (bittersweet cider apples), English (West Country), French (Normandy/Brittany), and Spanish (Asturias/Basque)
bjcp.org
. Strong Cider (C2) substyles include New England (chaptalized, raisin), Applewine (sweet apple wine), Ice Cider (freeze-concentrated), and Fire Cider (flavored with spirits)
bjcp.org
. Specialty Cider (C3) covers ciders with additional ingredients or processes, including Fruit Cider, Spiced Cider, Hopped Cider, Botanical Cider, Rosé Cider, Wood-Aged Cider, and Sour Cider
ciderassociation.org
ciderassociation.org
. This system is widely used in competitions and emphasizes both the apple base and any adjuncts or methods.

In the UK, CAMRA’s real cider criteria emphasize regional styles and methods. For example, CAMRA distinguishes Western Counties (Somerset/Herefordshire) ciders – made from high-tannin “bittersweet” apples, yielding bold structure – from Eastern counties (East Anglia/Kent) ciders – made from low-tannin eating apples, yielding a bright, fruity acidity

members.camra.org.uk
. CAMRA also notes Keeved Cider (Normandy-style), a naturally sweet, bottle-conditioned cider made by a partial slow fermentation
members.camra.org.uk
. Beyond geography, CAMRA lists Fruit/Flavoured ciders (with berries, etc.), Spiced/Botanical ciders, Bottle-Fermented (méthode champenoise), Ice Cider, Rosé, and even Cider Spirits (apple brandy, pommeau) as distinct styles
ciderassociation.org
ciderassociation.org
.

North American classification (e.g. US Association of Cider Makers) similarly recognizes Modern vs Heritage styles. “Modern” ciders use neutral dessert apples and tend to be bright and low-tannin, whereas “Heritage” ciders use classic bittersweet apple varieties and have more tannin and complexity
ciderassociation.org
ciderassociation.org
. The US style guide also specifically includes New England Style (high-ABV, chaptalized, with raisins/spices) and Applewine
ciderassociation.org
, as well as Ice Cider (natural freeze concentration)
ciderassociation.org
. Specialty categories cover Single- and Mixed-Fruit Ciders, Hopped Ciders, Spiced Ciders, Rosé (pink) Ciders, Wood-Aged Ciders, and Sour Ciders
ciderassociation.org
ciderassociation.org
.

Finally, national bodies in emerging markets have their own frameworks. For example, the Australian Cider Awards differentiate “New World” (lower-tannin table-apple) vs “Traditional” (bittersweet-apple) ciders, plus classes for fruit/herb/spice cider and ice cider. German Apfelwein is usually treated as its own style (4–7% ABV, very dry and tart
en.wikipedia.org
). In summary, the major classification systems agree on a few key axes: base apple type (dessert vs cider apple), sweetness level (dry–sweet), carbonation (still/pétillant/sparkling), and added ingredients or methods (fruit, hops, spices, barrel aging, ice/concentration, bottle conditioning, etc.), though the precise categories vary.

Recommended Taxonomy for the App

Each cider could be tagged in multiple relevant nodes (e.g. an “Eastern UK still dry cider aged in oak with cinnamon”). The taxonomy allows overlap (e.g. a cider can be both “Traditional English – Dry” and “Spiced Cider”). It combines official style names with practical descriptors (sweetness, carbonation, additives) so a collector can mark off all axes.

Cider starts with apples: traditional styles rely on cider-specific apple varieties with high tannin for structure, while modern/table-apple ciders use sweeter eating apples
members.camra.org.uk
. For example, West Country (England) ciders use “bittersweet” apples, whereas Eastern ciders use low-tannin dessert apples, yielding a sharper-fruity profile
members.camra.org.uk
members.camra.org.uk
. The BJCP guidelines capture this by listing English, French, Spanish, etc. as sub-styles of Traditional Cider
bjcp.org
.

After pressing, cider may be wild-fermented or inoculated. Special processes (keeving in Normandy or freeze-distillation in Canada) create sweet variants
members.camra.org.uk
ciderassociation.org
. The US style guide, for instance, includes Ice Cider (intensely sweet, freeze-concentrated) and New England Style (high-ABV with added sugars/raisins) as distinct categories
ciderassociation.org
ciderassociation.org
. Similarly, the UK CAMRA list identifies Fruit, Spiced, Hopped, and Botanical ciders as separate styles
ciderassociation.org
ciderassociation.org
.

Maturation adds further diversity. Many traditional ciders are fermented or aged in oak barrels; wood imparts vanilla/toasty notes
ciderassociation.org
. Bottle-conditioning (méthode champenoise) creates pétillant or sparkling variants. Overall, by combining region-style (e.g. “England – Still Dry”), adjunct/flavor (e.g. “Apple‑Pear”, “Ginger”), process (e.g. “Keeved”, “Barrel”), and characteristics (e.g. “Sweet”, “High Acidity”), our taxonomy can tag any cider.

Completeness Matrix of Styles

To “try all” ciders, a collector would target each combination of the above axes. For example:

Traditional English (West Country): try at least one still-dry, still-medium, and still-sweet version, and one sparkling (bottle-conditioned) dry and sweet.

Traditional English (Eastern): similarly one still-dry, medium, sweet (these use dessert apples)
members.camra.org.uk
.

French (Normandy/Brittany): try one Brut (dry, often fully fermented), one Demi-Sec (medium), and one Doux (sweet, keeved)
ciderassociation.org
ciderassociation.org
.

Spanish Sidra: try a Sidra Natural (traditional Asturian, very dry with high acidity and a touch of barnyard funk)
bjcp.org
; ideally also a modern bottled sidra (sparkling).

German Apfelwein: try a classic dry Apfelwein (Ebbelwoi) from Hesse
en.wikipedia.org
 (usually still, tart 6–7% ABV).

Modern/New World Cider: try at least one dry, medium, and sweet from contemporary craft producers (can be American, British, Australian, etc.). Include a New England style or Applewine for high-ABV/aged character
ciderassociation.org
.

Fruit Ciders: try cider blends with other fruits – e.g. apple-pear, apple-berry (cherry, blueberry, etc.), and an exotic fruit cider (mango, pineapple, etc.)
ciderassociation.org
.

Spiced/Botanical: try at least one with spices (cinnamon/ginger)
ciderassociation.org
, one with hops
ciderassociation.org
, and one with other botanicals (herbs, coffee, etc.).

Rosé Cider: try a pink cider made from red-fleshed apples (dry or sweet)
ciderassociation.org
.

Ice Cider: try a freeze-concentrated dessert-style cider
ciderassociation.org
.

Perry (Pear Cider): include a dry traditional perry and a sweeter fruit perry.

Special Processes: try a keeved cider (Normandy-Doux style)
members.camra.org.uk
, a barrel-aged cider, and a bottle-fermented sparkling cider.

Low/No Alcohol Cider: try a non-alcoholic cider (often apple juice with cider yeast)
members.camra.org.uk
.

In total, this yields on the order of 30–40 distinct style examples across all categories. A practical “completeness” criterion is to ensure at least one example from each cell in this matrix (each combination of base style × sweetness × carbonation × flavor/additive). Our app can mark progress by tracking which nodes (e.g. “English–Dry–Still” or “Fruit–Cherry” or “Barrel-aged”) have been checked off. By filling every box in the matrix above, a user will have genuinely sampled the full diversity of cider styles available.
