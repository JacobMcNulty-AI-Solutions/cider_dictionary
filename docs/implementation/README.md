# Implementation Plan

This folder contains the 4-phase implementation plan for the Cider Dictionary React Native application, developed using the SPARC methodology.

## Plan Structure

The implementation is divided into four sequential phases:

- **[Phase 1: Prototype](implementation-plan-phase-1.md)** - Basic working prototype with essential functionality
- **[Phase 2: Basic Features](implementation-plan-phase-2.md)** - Core features and improved data model
- **[Phase 3: MVP](implementation-plan-phase-3.md)** - Minimum viable product with production-ready features
- **[Phase 4: Full Features](implementation-plan-phase-4.md)** - Complete feature set with advanced functionality

## Implementation Approach

Each phase builds upon the previous one:

1. **Phase 1**: Establishes basic app structure with simplified data model (5 fields), basic SQLite storage, and minimal Firebase setup
2. **Phase 2**: Introduces comprehensive data model, encryption, venue database, and enhanced UI components
3. **Phase 3**: Adds production-level error handling, performance monitoring, analytics, and offline sync
4. **Phase 4**: Implements advanced features like venue consolidation, completeness algorithm, social features, and expert mode

## Key Technical Decisions

- **Technology Stack**: React Native 0.75.4 + Expo SDK 54 + TypeScript
- **Storage**: SQLite primary + Firebase sync (offline-first architecture)
- **UI Strategy**: Progressive disclosure (casual → enthusiast → expert levels)
- **Performance Targets**: 30-second quick entry, sub-200ms search
- **Security**: AES-256-GCM encryption for sensitive data (introduced in Phase 2)
- **Compliance**: Firebase free tier compliance with cost monitoring (Phase 3)

## Dependencies Between Phases

Each phase must be fully functional before proceeding to the next. Phase completion criteria are defined in each individual plan document.
