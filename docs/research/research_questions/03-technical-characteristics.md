# Research Specification: Technical Characteristics

## Project Context
We are building a personal cider journaling app called "Cider Dictionary" for a dedicated cider enthusiast whose goal is to systematically collect and catalog every possible cider variety. The user wants to achieve "collection completeness" by trying a cider with every characteristic at least once.

## Research Objective
Define comprehensive technical classification systems for cider characteristics that can be objectively measured or categorized, enabling systematic tracking of technical diversity in the collection.

## Specific Research Tasks

### 1. Sweetness Classifications
Research standardized sweetness scales for cider:
- **Industry standard scales**: Specific gravity ranges, residual sugar levels
- **Commercial terminology**: Bone dry, dry, off-dry, medium, sweet, dessert
- **Numerical scales**: Brix, specific gravity ranges for each category
- **Regional variations**: Different sweetness terminology by region/country

### 2. Alcohol Strength Categories
Research alcohol classification systems:
- **Standard ABV ranges**: Low, medium, high alcohol categories
- **Legal classifications**: Different countries' legal definitions
- **Style-specific ranges**: Typical ABV for different cider styles
- **Specialty categories**: Session, standard, strong, barley wine strength

### 3. Carbonation Classifications
Research carbonation level standards:
- **Still ciders**: No carbonation
- **Lightly sparkling**: Petillant, slight carbonation
- **Sparkling**: Standard carbonation levels
- **Highly carbonated**: Champagne-style carbonation
- **Measurement standards**: CO2 volumes, pressure measurements

### 4. Acidity and pH Classifications
Research acidity characteristics:
- **pH ranges**: Typical pH ranges for different cider styles
- **Acidity types**: Malic acid, tartaric acid, lactic acid contributions
- **Taste descriptors**: Sharp, tart, balanced, mellow
- **Technical measurements**: Titratable acidity standards

### 5. Tannin Classifications
Research tannin content and types:
- **Tannin levels**: Low, medium, high tannin categories
- **Tannin sources**: Apple variety, wood aging, additive tannins
- **Taste descriptors**: Astringent, grippy, soft, smooth
- **Technical measurements**: Industry tannin measurement standards

### 6. Color Classifications
Research cider color standards:
- **Color scales**: SRM, EBC, or cider-specific color scales
- **Visual descriptors**: Pale, golden, amber, copper, ruby, etc.
- **Clarity levels**: Crystal clear, hazy, cloudy, opaque
- **Color sources**: Apple variety, processing, aging, additives

## Deliverables Required

### 1. Technical Classification Matrix
Provide structured categories for each characteristic:
```
Sweetness
├── Bone Dry (SG < 1.000)
├── Dry (SG 1.000-1.004)
├── Off-Dry (SG 1.004-1.009)
├── Medium (SG 1.009-1.015)
└── Sweet (SG > 1.015)

Alcohol Strength
├── Session (< 4.5% ABV)
├── Standard (4.5-6.5% ABV)
├── Strong (6.5-8.5% ABV)
└── Very Strong (> 8.5% ABV)
```

### 2. Measurement Standards
Define practical measurement/identification methods:
- How to determine characteristics from commercial labels
- Visual/taste cues for classification
- When technical measurements are available vs estimated

### 3. Collection Completeness Framework
Create a matrix showing all characteristic combinations to try:
- Sweetness × Alcohol × Carbonation × Acidity combinations
- Minimum number of ciders needed to cover all technical characteristics
- Priority characteristics for systematic collection

### 4. UK Commercial Context
Focus on UK market standards:
- UK industry terminology and standards
- Common UK commercial cider characteristic ranges
- Regulatory requirements affecting labeling

## Success Criteria
The research should enable creation of a comprehensive technical classification system that allows objective categorization of every cider tried and tracking progress toward experiencing all technical characteristic combinations.

## Output Format
Please structure findings as:
1. **Complete technical taxonomy with measurement ranges**
2. **Practical identification guide for consumers**
3. **Collection completeness matrix**
4. **UK market-specific standards**
5. **Sources and technical references**
